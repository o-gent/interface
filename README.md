Dronekit allows control of an ardupilot device with python, however it is written in python 2.7. This project allows dronekit functionality through python 3 by sending and receiving strings to/from a python 2 process.

Currently dronekit-sitl is setup however a couple of lines changed will allow the connection to an ardupilot vehicle.
